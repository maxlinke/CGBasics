  m_description: Non-physically-based lighting model. The lambert term is wrapped
    around the object, so that the side facing away from the light doesn't look as
    flat. It was developed for the original Half-Life and was still used in Source
    on the faces of characters, as it somewhat simulates subsurface scattering.
